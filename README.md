# Etch-A-Sketch

LIVE DEMO: https://ggriffey.github.io/Etch-A-Sketch/

Built in conjunction with the Odin Project curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

Working on this web app really helped me hone my skills of using event listeners, manipulating styles through JS, 
and working with the virtual DOM. 

It was also one of the first projects in which I had to seriously refactor code. Originally, the 
functionality for painting on the grid was neither efficient or easily-readable. It had some bugs 
that needed working out, which sent me down a path of critically thinking about what I 
actually wanted to achieve (in terms of painting on the canvas).

Definitely hit some road blocks on this one that I had to work through, but it was a fun project 
to build nonetheless.
