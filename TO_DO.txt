ETCH A SKETCH TO DO:
====================
    
X   Need to update painting to "off" when user LEAVES the grid, even if 
    they are still holding the mouse down. Currently, if they click and 
    drag outside of the grid then release the click, painting is still on 

X   Change hover-to-paint so that the user must click and drag instead.
    This makes painting much easier and versatile.

X   Allow user to pick color. I'm thinking something like:
                         
            Choose color :  |=| (<-- this is a box that you can click
                                to change the color. When you click it,
                                it expands into a bigger circle where you 
                                can select a color by clicking/dragging.)

o   Add the ability to customize the grid size.
    I think a slider would be the most fun and functional.
    The circle that you slide from left to right could get
    bigger as the number of cells decreases (as the "paintbrush"
    would be increasing in size") and smaller as the grid size 
    increases. This may be hard to figure out in terms of css
    but it would be a good challenge to have the circle fluidly
    change as you slide it back and forth.

X   Add a border to the container div and make it look more like
    a canvas and less like a grid of cells. 

X   Shrink the distance between the cells (border thickness?). 
    Does this have anything to do with the fact that I went with
    creating a table versus a grid of divs? Regardless, I think
    there's a css attribute for decreasing the space between elements.

o   Maybe add the ability to toggle the grid lines on/off

x   Fix layout of all elements on the page. Reset button and color picker
    should be more centered and evenly distributed in their div
